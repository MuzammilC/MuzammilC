### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Muzammil Chunawala.

I'm a second-year at UBC who is extremely passionate about learning new skills and growing in various areas. My interests include Data Science, Object-Oriented Programming, and overall working on projects that have an impact. My primary goal, for now, is to learn and experience as much as I can while making some amazing connections along the journey.
